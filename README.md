Kronos Bot
The source code for Kronos Bot
- Made with the Nextcord library in Python
- Any errors here are yours to correct, though there shouldn't be many
- You will need to edit emojis.py with the required data so the bot can work
- Also edit the 'token' variable in main.py so the bot can run

Additional Needs
- For the QR command, you need a directory and put the path into the code
- You also need a directory called "help/"

This code is free, and no attribution is required, however it would be appreciated if you link to this repo, as I've spent some time working on these.
